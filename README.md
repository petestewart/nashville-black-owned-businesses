After seeing a lot of graphics and lists with black-owned businesses in Nashville, I decided I'd try to make a simple interactive app that displays them for people in a useful manner.

Initially this is focused on restaraunts that deliver and/or offer carry-out, but it could certianly be expanded to much more.
